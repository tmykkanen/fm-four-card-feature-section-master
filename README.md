## My process

### Built with

- ![Astro](https://img.shields.io/badge/astro-%232C2052.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=astro&logoColor=white)
- ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

### What I learned

- I spent a lot of time exploring layout options for CSS Grid and learned better how both grid and flexbox work.

### Continued development

- I found Tailwind more cumbersome when modifying many things with container queries. So I'd like to continue to improve my ability to use vanilla css for more and rely on tailwind for rapid prototyping.
